    <p>
      Hello! My name is <em>Caleb Fraser</em> and I am from Ottawa. I have a dog named Ruby who loves to cause trouble
      but pretends she's innocent. I also have two birds. They are both parakeets—one is blue and the other is green. I
      have also had three other parakeets and two other dogs in the past. I enjoy playing video games, listening to
      music and spending time on the computer.

      In high school I took several computer science–related classes that I really enjoyed. I did similar things to what
      we are learning in class like using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr
        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript. I was also in the Computer Engineering Technology –
      Computing Science program at the college last year but it wasn’t for me so I decided to switch to this program
      instead. I am excited to continue learning about web design and I plan for it to be a major part of my life going
      forward. I'm going to try my best to get a 100<sup>%</sup> in this course!!
